      <h3>who is Nelson Mandela? :</h3>
      <p id="p1">
        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (born Rolihlahla Mandela /mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa:
        [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African
        anti-apartheid revolutionary political leader who served as the first
        president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first
        black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative
        democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of
        apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial
        reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he
        served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party
        from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal
        family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University
        of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a
        lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and
        African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding
        its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only
        government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that
        privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its
        overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch,
        rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign
        and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for
        seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956
        Treason Trial. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in
        association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe
        in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was
        arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was
        sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.
